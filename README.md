# VerilogDesign

Currently this code is not licensed to any entity other than the author, Ben Constable. A
license will be decided on at a later date.

This is a place for my Verilog / FPGA experiments. Read the PhaethonOverview.txt for more 
information.

If you have been sent a link to this then you are welcome to browse and read the code. I
hope you gain as much enjoyment reading it as I got from building it!
