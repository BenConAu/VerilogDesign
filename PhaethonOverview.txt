Instruction set overview

The Phaethon instruction set is designed to be simple to implement, but allow for powerful
instructions to be added to the instruction set. An attempt has been made to allow for
cooperative development between the hardware, the instruction set and the high level
language for shader development.

Only move instructions have variants beyond registers and constants. This is intended
to push most code generation towards using registers.

Function calls can be done through traditional stack means, or through using register
window shifting. After a window shift, the r0 register becomes the first argument to
the function being called.
